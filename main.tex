\chapter*{Introduction}
\section*{What is this?}
This is a project to keep all of my notes for my Calculus I class in a nice PDF file.
\section*{About this project}
This PDF is created using a combination of \LaTeX\ and Wolfram Mathematica. All code for this project can be found on its \href{https://github.com/Cobbleopolis/Calculus-Notes}{GitHub page}. This project is intended to be built on a Windows computer because it relies on running a \texttt{.bat} file at compile time.

Also, if any errors are found in the PDF please create an issue on this project's GitHub page \href{https://github.com/Cobbleopolis/Calculus-Notes/issues}{here}. This includes any errors in the math or spelling or grammar errors as my editor that I use for this project does not have spell check.
