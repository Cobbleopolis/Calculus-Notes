\section{Newton's Method}
How do we solve equations like $x^3 - 4x + 2 = 0$?
\begin{itemize}
    \item We could use a calculator\ldots But what about before calculators? And HOW do calculators solve it?
    \item We could factor it. But factoring polynomials of high degrees really isn't fun. Maybe it doesn't factor (i.e. $\sin^2(x) + 2x - 5$)
    \item There are a variety of \textit{numerical methods} that calculators and computers use to find roots of equations.
    \item One such method id Newton's Method.
\end{itemize}
