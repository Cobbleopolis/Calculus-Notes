# Introduction

## What is this?

This is a project to keep all of my notes for my Calculus I class together and organized.

## About this project

This site is made using markdown compiled with MkDocs and uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to typeset mathmatics an uses the [Function Plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) library on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to render graphs. All code for this project can be found on it's GitHub [here](https://github.com/Cobbleopolis/Calculus-Notes)

    \lim_{x \to -\infty}{\left(x^2\right)} &= \infty
\end{align}
